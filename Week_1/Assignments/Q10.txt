We can perform arithmetic operations in a shell script using several methods. Here's how:

- $((expression)):

Use (( )) for integer arithmetic.
Example: result=$((3 + 5)).

- expr command:

A legacy tool for arithmetic.
Example: result=$(expr 3 + 5).

- let command:

For simpler syntax, often used in older scripts.
Example: let result=3+5.

- bc command:

Handles floating-point arithmetic.
Example: result=$(echo "3.5 + 2.5" | bc).

- Variables:

Store results in variables for reuse.
Example: sum=$((a + b)).
