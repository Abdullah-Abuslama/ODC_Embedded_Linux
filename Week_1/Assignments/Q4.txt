- Standard output (stdout):

> Used for normal program output (e.g., displaying results/data).
> File descriptor: 1.
> Can be redirected using > (overwrite) or >> (append).

- Standard error (stderr):

> Used for error messages and diagnostics.
> File descriptor: 2.
> Can be redirected using 2> (overwrite) or 2>> (append).

- Differences:

> stdout is for regular output, while stderr is for error messages.
> Allows separation of normal output and errors for better management.

- Combining streams:

> Redirect both stdout and stderr using 2>&1 to merge them into one output.
